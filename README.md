## Project Goals

During this project, we aim to redesign the UI of a hot beverage vending machine. Many existing vending machine UIs are either too simplistic, lacking sufficient customization options, or overly complex, offering too many choices. Our goal is to create a new UI that is simple and intuitive while providing advanced users with enough options to brew their perfect beverage.

## Methodology

We will evaluate the usability of the current hot beverage vending machine at FRI using surveys and focus groups, leveraging Figma for design prototyping. 

1. **Initial Survey:**  
   A survey targeting as many FRI students as possible will be conducted to identify pain points and guide a preliminary UI redesign in Figma.  
   
2. **Focus Group Testing:**  
   A smaller focus group consisting of our peers will provide qualitative feedback on the prototype. Open discussions will refine the UI further.  
   
3. **Final Survey:**  
   A second survey will assess the usability and satisfaction of the revised interface, targeting a broad audience of FRI students.

## Execution Plan

1. **Initial Survey:**  
   Conduct a survey among FRI students to identify usability issues and gather feedback on the current vending machine.  

2. **Data Analysis and Preliminary Design:**  
   Analyze survey results to uncover key themes and design a new UI in Figma that balances simplicity and customization for improved user interaction.  

3. **Focus Group Testing:**  
   Gather qualitative feedback from a focus group to refine the initial Figma design further.  

4. **Final Survey:**  
   Conduct a second survey to evaluate the refined UI, focusing on user satisfaction and ease of use.  

5. **Documentation and Analysis:**  
   Document findings from surveys and focus group discussions, summarizing insights and design iterations to outline project outcomes and future recommendations.
